# bees-engine
A engine for goats-and-tigers.

This engine is only designed for Goats and Tigers. It is meant to be compiled into web assembly and run in the web. 

Bees still is not finished and very much subject to change. This engine will be come enablable to use on the offical goats-and-tigers web version when it is finished. It
is designed to replace the old javascript engine that is being used currently.
